# Text-file-parsing-with-a-C-program
At the request of a stock trader I wrote this program to select ## Latest News and ### Latest Market News information from a cnbc text file named cnbc2.txt into a new text file, cnbcLog.txt. This is written so it amends the cnbcLog.txt. file every time your run the program.
